I am currently a visiting scholar working with [Prof. Upmanu Lall](https://www.eee.columbia.edu/faculty/upmanu-lall) 
at [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu/). 

I completed my Ph.D. at Wuhan University under the supervision of [Prof. Lihua Xiong](http://waterlab.whu.edu.cn/index.php/Researcher/userinfo/uid/9.html) in the department of Hydrology and Water Resources, 
focusing on the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydro-meteorological extremes using 
statistical techniques. 

Currently, my primary research interest is the modeling and prediction of ENSO events
using machine learning methods and its tele-connection with precipitation, renewable resources and other 
hydro-meteorological extremes.
