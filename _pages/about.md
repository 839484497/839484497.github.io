I am currently a visiting scholar at the Columbia Water Center. 
I completed my Ph.D. at Wuhan University in the department of Hydrology and Water Resources, 
focusing on the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydro-meteorological extremes using 
statistical techniques. Currently, my primary research interest is the modeling and prediction of ENSO events
using machine learning methods and its tele-connection with precipitation, renewable resources and other 
hydro-meteorological extremes.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
